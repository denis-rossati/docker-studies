# This is just a initial overview

You can think about it as a instanace of an gerenciable image that can be run locally, in VM or even deployed to the cloud.

Also, containers run their own software, binaries, etc. Wich means that they can run in any OS 

A container image MUST HAVE all the dependencies, configurantions, scripts, everything to make the user able to run a software.

This include other metadata, commands, env variables and etc.
