# Docker Studies

I'm learning docker!

This repo are very similar to the typescript repository that I created a while ago. I'll just write instructions and brain line that helped me to understand some subject.

To have a good overview of what docker is cappable of, I'll follow the docker guide step by step. Then I'll dive deep in the docs and to finish the cycle, create a project in other repo :D
